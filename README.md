# Home Credit Scored Model

## Project Description
Home Credit is currently using various statistical methods and Machine Learning to make credit score predictions. Now, we ask you to unlock the maximum potential of our data. In this way, we can ensure that customers who are able to make repayments are not rejected when applying for a loan, and loans can be given with a principal, maturity, and payment calendar that will motivate customers to be successful.

## Dataset
- bureau - All client's previous credits provided by other financial institutions that were
reported to Credit Bureau (for clients who have a loan in our sample).
- bureau_balance - Monthly balances of previous credits in Credit Bureau.
- POS_CASH - Monthly balance snapshots of previous POS (point of sales) and cash loans that
the applicant had with Home Credit.
- credit_card_balance - Monthly balance snapshots of previous credit cards that the applicant has with
Home Credit.
- previous_application - All previous applications for Home Credit loans of clients who have loans in our
sample.
- installment_payments - Repayment history for the previously disbursed credits in Home Credit related to
the loans in our sample.

All the datasets have been cleaned and combined to be on a dataset called _application_train_.
